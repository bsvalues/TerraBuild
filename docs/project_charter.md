# BCBS Project Charter

## Project Overview

The Benton County Building Cost System (BCBS) is a sophisticated SaaS platform designed to revolutionize building cost assessment and property valuation for the Benton County Assessor's Office in Washington state. This project aims to transform traditional property assessment workflows by implementing cutting-edge technologies and user-centric design.

## High-Level Objectives

1. **Accurate Building Cost Assessment**: Implement a precise cost calculation engine that leverages the Benton County cost matrix data to provide accurate building valuations.

2. **Streamlined Assessment Workflow**: Create an intuitive interface that simplifies and accelerates the property assessment process for county officials.

3. **Data-Driven Insights**: Enable advanced analytics and visualizations to identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities in property valuations.

4. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Facilitate secure sharing and collaborative assessment between county departments and external stakeholders.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure all calculations and methodologies comply with Washington state assessment standards and Benton County regulations.

## Success Criteria

1. **Accuracy**: Cost calculations match or exceed the accuracy of traditional methods (within 2% variance).

2. **Efficiency**: Reduce assessment processing time by at least 40% compared to current methods.

3. **User Adoption**: Achieve 85%+ user satisfaction ratings from county assessors and staff.

4. **Data Coverage**: Successfully import and process 100% of Benton County property data.

5. **Compliance**: Pass all regulatory audits with no significant findings.
