# BCBS Replit AI Agent Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for implementing the Replit AI Agent approach in the Benton County Building Cost System (BCBS) project. These documents provide a structured framework based on the PM playbook approach and leverage the existing Model Content Protocol (MCP) for advanced AI capabilities.

## Document Index

### Core Project Documents

- [**Project Charter**](./project_charter.md) - Defines project goals, success criteria, stakeholders, and technical risks
- [**Project Backlog**](./backlog.md) - Organizes work items in a Kanban-style board with user stories and technical tasks

### Implementation Strategy

- [**AI Agent Strategy**](./bcbs_agent_strategy.md) - Overall strategy for implementing AI agents in the BCBS project
- [**Sprint 1 Implementation Plan**](./sprint_1_implementation_plan.md) - Detailed plan for the first sprint with specific tasks and timelines
- [**CI/CD Implementation Guide**](./cicd_implementation_guide.md) - Step-by-step approach for implementing CI/CD with Docker, GitHub Actions, and Terraform

### Technical Guides

- [**Replit AI Agent Guide**](./replit_ai_agent_guide.md) - How to use the Replit AI Agent effectively with specific prompt templates
- [**MCP Agent Integration**](./mcp_agent_integration.md) - Guide to leveraging the Model Content Protocol with Replit AI Agent

### Component Improvement Examples

- [**Cost Calculator Review**](./cost_calculator_review.md) - Analysis and improvement plan for the BCBSCostCalculator component
- [**AI-Generated Hook Example**](./ai_generated_hook_example.md) - Sample implementation of a custom hook using AI Agent
- [**TDD with AI Agent**](./tdd_with_ai_agent.md) - Test-driven development approach using the AI Agent

### Comprehensive Guide

- [**Replit AI Agent Implementation Guide**](./replit_ai_agent_implementation_guide.md) - Brings all resources together in a comprehensive implementation guide

## Getting Started

1. Begin by reviewing the [Project Charter](./project_charter.md) to understand the overall goals
2. Examine the [Project Backlog](./backlog.md) to see the prioritized work items
3. Read the [Replit AI Agent Implementation Guide](./replit_ai_agent_implementation_guide.md) for a comprehensive overview
4. Set up the CI/CD infrastructure using the [CI/CD Implementation Guide](./cicd_implementation_guide.md)
5. Begin implementation with the [Sprint 1 Implementation Plan](./sprint_1_implementation_plan.md)

## Best Practices

- Use the prompt templates in the [Replit AI Agent Guide](./replit_ai_agent_guide.md)
- Follow the test-driven development approach in [TDD with AI Agent](./tdd_with_ai_agent.md)
- Leverage the existing MCP framework as described in [MCP Agent Integration](./mcp_agent_integration.md)
- Implement CI/CD best practices from the [CI/CD Implementation Guide](./cicd_implementation_guide.md)
- Monitor progress using the metrics defined in the implementation guide

## Maintenance

This documentation will evolve as the project progresses. Updates should be made to reflect:

- New lessons learned from AI Agent implementation
- Additional prompt templates that prove effective
- New components and features implemented
- Changes to the project structure or architecture

## Contributors

This documentation was created using the Replit AI Agent based on the PM playbook approach provided.
