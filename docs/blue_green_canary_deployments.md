## Overview

The BCBS application uses advanced deployment strategies to ensure zero downtime, increased safety, and the ability to quickly rollback if issues are detected. The implemented approach provides:

- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Gradual traffic shifting for canary deployments
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Blue-Green Deployment

### What is Blue-Green Deployment?

Blue-Green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green. At any time, only one of the environments is live, serving all production traffic. 

### How it Works in BCBS

1. **Initial Setup**: We maintain two identical environments (Blue and Green).
2. **Live Environment**: Initially, Blue is active and Green is idle.
3. **Deployment Process**:
   - New code is deployed to the idle environment (Green).
   - Tests and validations are performed on Green.
   - When Green is verified, the load balancer routes traffic from Blue to Green.
   - Green becomes the active environment and Blue becomes idle.
4. **Rollback Process**:
   - If issues are detected in Green, traffic is immediately routed back to Blue.

### Implementation Details

- AWS Application Load Balancer with target groups for Blue and Green.
- ECS Services with Fargate tasks for both environments.
- Lambda function for automated rollback.
- CloudWatch Alarms for detecting issues.

## Canary Deployment

### What is Canary Deployment?

Canary deployment is a technique where a small percentage of traffic is directed to the new version of the application, allowing for monitoring and verification before directing all traffic to the new version.

### How it Works in BCBS

1. **Initial Setup**: We deploy the new version alongside the current version.
2. **Traffic Shifting**:
   - Initially direct a small percentage (e.g., 5%) of traffic to the new version.
   - Monitor for errors, performance issues, or other problems.
   - If the new version performs well, gradually increase the percentage.
   - Once validated, shift 100% of traffic to the new version.
3. **Rollback Process**:
   - If issues are detected, immediately route all traffic back to the original version.

### Implementation Details

- AWS Application Load Balancer with weighted target groups.
- ECS Service for the canary deployment.
- Lambda function for traffic control and monitoring.
- CloudWatch Alarms with specific thresholds for the canary deployment.

## Automated Rollback Mechanism

Both Blue-Green and Canary deployments include automated rollback mechanisms:

1. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics track error rates, response times, and other key indicators.
2. **Alerting**: Alarms trigger when metrics exceed thresholds.
3. **Rollback Function**: Lambda functions automatically:
   - Redirect traffic back to the stable version.
   - Scale down the problematic deployment.
   - Send notifications to the operations team.

## Terraform Implementation

The deployment strategies are implemented using Terraform with a modular approach:

```
terrafusion/
├── modules/
│   ├── deployment/
│   │   ├── main.tf            # Core deployment infrastructure
│   │   ├── blue_green.tf      # Blue-Green deployment resources
│   │   ├── canary.tf          # Canary deployment resources
│   │   ├── variables.tf       # Input variables
│   │   └── outputs.tf         # Output values
│   ├── networking/            # VPC, subnets, etc.
│   └── database/              # RDS resources
├── functions/                 # Lambda functions
│   ├── rollback-function.js   # Automated rollback
│   └── canary-function.js     # Canary deployment control
├── environments/              # Environment-specific configs
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
└── terraform-setup.sh         # Setup script
```

## CI/CD Integration

The deployment strategies are fully integrated with our CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Build and Test**: Code is built and tested in the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **Infrastructure Deployment**: Terraform applies infrastructure changes.
3. **Application Deployment**:
   - For Blue-Green: Deploy to the inactive environment.
   - For Canary: Deploy and control traffic percentage.
4. **Automated Verification**: Run tests against the new deployment.
5. **Traffic Shifting**: Controlled by Lambda functions or CI/CD workflows.
6. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring during and after deployment.

## Monitoring and Alerting

Comprehensive monitoring includes:

1. **CloudWatch Metrics**:
   - Error rates (5xx, 4xx)
   - Response times
   - CPU and memory utilization
   - Request counts
   
2. **CloudWatch Alarms**:
   - High error rate thresholds
   - Latency thresholds
   - Health check failures
   
3. **Notifications**:
   - SNS topics for alert delivery
   - Integration with incident management systems
   
4. **Logging**:
   - Centralized logs in CloudWatch
   - Structured logging format
   - Retention policies for different environments

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Parity**: Ensure Blue and Green environments are identical.
2. **Database Changes**: Use compatible database migrations.
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing before shifting traffic.
4. **Monitoring**: Set appropriate thresholds for alerts.
5. **Incremental Canary**: Start with small traffic percentages (1-5%).
6. **Automated Rollback**: Ensure rollback mechanisms are tested regularly.
7. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for larger changes.
8. **Documentation**: Keep deployment procedures documented.
9. **Security**: Maintain security controls across all environments.
10. **Compliance**: Ensure all environments meet compliance requirements.
