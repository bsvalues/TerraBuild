# BCBS AI Agent Implementation Strategy

This document outlines the implementation strategy for using Replit AI Agent to enhance and develop the Benton County Building Cost System (BCBS) project.

## Project Overview

The BCBS application is a sophisticated SaaS platform for Building Cost Building application management in Benton County, Washington. It's designed to revolutionize infrastructure cost calculation and property assessment through intelligent technology and user-centric design.

### Tech Stack
- TypeScript full-stack implementation
- React with modular, responsive UI components
- Supabase PostgreSQL integration
- Machine learning-powered cost calculation algorithms
- Tailwind CSS for consistent design system
- MCP (Model Content Protocol) for AI integration

## Implementation Strategy

We'll implement the AI Agent approach from the PM playbook in phases, focusing on the core components of the BCBS system.

### Phase 1: Project Analysis and Charter

**Objective**: Analyze the existing codebase and establish a clear project charter.

**Tasks**:
1. Execute a comprehensive codebase review
2. Identify core functionalities and components
3. Document high-level objectives and success criteria
4. Define user personas and their pain points
5. Identify technical risks

**Deliverable**: `docs/project_charter.md`

### Phase 2: Backlog and Sprint Planning

**Objective**: Break down development into manageable tasks and organize them into sprints.

**Tasks**:
1. Define user stories based on the charter
2. Prioritize technical tasks
3. Organize into a Kanban-style backlog
4. Assign effort estimations to each task
5. Plan the first sprint

**Deliverable**: `docs/backlog.md`

### Phase 3: Architecture and Foundation

**Objective**: Enhance the existing foundation to support future development.

**Tasks**:
1. Optimize CI/CD workflow
2. Clean up codebase structure
3. Standardize component architecture
4. Enhance testing framework
5. Optimize database queries and schema

**Deliverable**: Multiple PRs with specific improvements

### Phase 4: Core Cost Matrix Workflow

**Objective**: Implement or refine the core cost matrix calculation workflow.

**Tasks**:
1. Enhance the cost matrix import functionality
2. Optimize calculation algorithms
3. Add validation for input parameters
4. Implement comprehensive error handling
5. Add unit and integration tests

**Deliverable**: Enhanced cost matrix workflow

### Phase 5: API Enhancement

**Objective**: Standardize and improve the API layer.

**Tasks**:
1. Standardize API endpoints
2. Implement proper validation
3. Add error handling
4. Improve documentation
5. Increase test coverage

**Deliverable**: Standardized API endpoints with documentation

### Phase 6: Observability and Quality

**Objective**: Implement observability and quality metrics.

**Tasks**:
1. Add comprehensive logging
2. Implement performance monitoring
3. Set up alerts for critical issues
4. Add user action tracking
5. Establish quality gates

**Deliverable**: Observability framework and quality metrics

## Using the AI Agent

For each phase, we'll use the Replit AI Agent following these guidelines:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Define clear objectives for the AI agent
   - Provide necessary context from existing code
   - Set acceptance criteria

2. **Implementation**:
   - Use specific, targeted prompts
   - Break complex tasks into smaller steps
   - Ask for explanations of generated code
   - Review changes before committing

3. **Review**:
   - Test generated code thoroughly
   - Check for edge cases
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Verify against acceptance criteria

4. **Reporting**:
   - Document AI agent contributions
   - Note any limitations or issues
   - Track progress against the plan

## Agent Prompt Templates

### Code Review Prompt
```
Review the [file/module] and provide:
1. Overview of functionality
2. Potential bugs or issues
3. Opportunities for improvement
4. Code quality assessment
```

### Implementation Prompt
```
Implement a [component/feature] that:
1. Accomplishes [specific goal]
2. Handles [specific edge cases]
3. Uses [specific design patterns or technologies]
4. Follows our codebase conventions
```

### Testing Prompt
```
Create tests for [component/feature] that:
1. Cover all primary use cases
2. Test edge cases including [specific edge cases]
3. Mock dependencies appropriately
4. Achieve high code coverage
```
