# Sprint 1 Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for Sprint 1 of the BCBS project, following the PM playbook approach and using the Replit AI Agent.

## Sprint Goals

Based on our project charter and backlog, Sprint 1 will focus on:

1. **Foundation & Architecture**
   - Code organization improvements
   - Component structure standardization
   - Testing framework setup

2. **Cost Calculator Refactoring**
   - Break down large component into smaller, manageable pieces
   - Extract calculation logic into reusable hooks
   - Improve error handling and validation

3. **Documentation**
   - Technical documentation for components
   - API documentation
   - User guide for cost calculator

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Code Organization Improvements

#### 1.1 Folder Structure Standardization

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Analyze our client/src directory structure and recommend a standardized folder organization that:
1. Groups related components together
2. Separates UI components from business logic
3. Maintains clear boundaries between features
4. Follows React best practices

Then, create a plan for reorganizing our files without breaking functionality.
```

#### 1.2 Component Naming Conventions

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Create a naming convention document that standardizes:
1. Component naming (PascalCase, descriptive, purpose-first)
2. Hook naming (camelCase, prefixed with 'use')
3. Utility function naming (camelCase, verb-first)
4. File naming to match export names
5. Test file naming

Provide examples of current files that should be renamed.
```

### 2. Cost Calculator Refactoring

#### 2.1 Component Breakdown

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Break down the BCBSCostCalculator component into smaller, modular components:

1. Create a CostCalculatorForm component for input handling
2. Create a CostBreakdownDisplay component for showing calculation results
3. Create a CostVisualization component for charts and graphs
4. Create an ExportOptions component for export functionality
5. Create a parent CostCalculator component that orchestrates these components

Ensure each component has a single responsibility and proper prop typing.
```

#### 2.2 Custom Hooks Extraction

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Extract the following calculation logic from BCBSCostCalculator into custom hooks:

1. Create useCostCalculation hook for core calculation logic
2. Create useRegionalFactors hook for region-specific multipliers
3. Create useDepreciation hook for age-based depreciation
4. Create usePropertyType hook for property-specific calculations

Each hook should be well-documented and have comprehensive TypeScript types.
```

#### 2.3 Error Handling Improvement

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Enhance error handling in the cost calculator components:

1. Add form validation with clear error messages
2. Implement graceful error states for calculations
3. Add fallback UI for when calculations fail
4. Implement error boundaries around visualization components
5. Add error logging for debugging purposes

Use zod validation and follow our existing error handling patterns.
```

### 3. Testing Framework Setup

#### 3.1 Test Configuration

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Set up a comprehensive testing framework for our BCBS application:

1. Configure Jest and React Testing Library
2. Set up test utilities for common testing scenarios
3. Create mock providers for context testing
4. Set up code coverage reporting
5. Document testing best practices
```

#### 3.2 Component Tests

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Create tests for our newly refactored cost calculator components:

1. Unit tests for each custom hook
2. Component tests for each UI component
3. Integration tests for the full calculator functionality
4. Test cases for error handling and edge cases
5. Snapshot tests for UI components
```

### 4. Documentation

#### 4.1 API Documentation

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Create comprehensive API documentation for the cost calculation functionality:

1. Document all input parameters with types and constraints
2. Document calculation logic and formulas
3. Document output format and fields
4. Include examples of API usage
5. Document error responses and handling
```

#### 4.2 User Guide

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Create a user guide for the cost calculator:

1. Step-by-step instructions for basic usage
2. Explanation of each input field and its impact
3. Guide to understanding the calculation results
4. Instructions for exporting and sharing results
5. Troubleshooting common issues
```

## Implementation Approach

For each task, we'll follow this workflow:

1. **Analysis**: Use the AI Agent to analyze the current code
2. **Planning**: Create a detailed plan for changes
3. **Implementation**: Generate code using the AI Agent
4. **Testing**: Verify changes with automated tests
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect changes
6. **Review**: Manual review of all changes

## Timeline

| Task | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1.1 Folder Structure Standardization | 1 day | None |
| 1.2 Component Naming Conventions | 0.5 day | None |
| 2.1 Component Breakdown | 2 days | 1.1, 1.2 |
| 2.2 Custom Hooks Extraction | 1.5 days | 1.1, 1.2 |
| 2.3 Error Handling Improvement | 1 day | 2.1, 2.2 |
| 3.1 Test Configuration | 1 day | None |
| 3.2 Component Tests | 2 days | 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1 |
| 4.1 API Documentation | 1 day | 2.1, 2.2 |
| 4.2 User Guide | 1 day | 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 |

Total duration: 10 working days

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of Sprint 1, we expect to have:

1. A standardized code organization structure
2. A well-documented naming convention
3. A refactored cost calculator with:
   - Smaller, focused components
   - Reusable calculation hooks
   - Improved error handling
   - Comprehensive tests
4. Complete documentation for developers and users

## Metrics for Success

1. **Code Coverage**: Aim for >80% test coverage for new/refactored components
2. **Component Size**: No component should exceed 250 lines of code
3. **Build Success**: All builds should pass without warnings
4. **Performance**: No regression in calculator performance
5. **Documentation**: All new components and hooks must be documented
