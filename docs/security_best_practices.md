## Infrastructure Security

### Network Isolation

- **VPC Configuration**: All resources are deployed in a private VPC with appropriate subnet separation.
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive security groups limit access between components.
- **Network ACLs**: Additional layer of security for controlling traffic.

Example security group configuration:

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "app" {
  name        = "${var.app_name}-${var.environment}-app-sg"
  description = "Security group for application servers"
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_id

  # Only allow incoming traffic from the load balancer
  ingress {
    from_port       = 5000
    to_port         = 5000
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [var.lb_security_group_id]
  }

  # Outbound access for updates and dependencies
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

### Encryption

- **Data at Rest**: All storage volumes, databases, and S3 buckets are encrypted.
- **Data in Transit**: All external and internal communication uses TLS.
- **Secret Management**: AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for credentials.

### Infrastructure as Code Security

- **Minimize Manual Changes**: All infrastructure changes should be made through Terraform code.
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure code is versioned and reviewed before deployment.
- **Terraform State Security**: State files stored in encrypted S3 buckets with limited access.

## Application Security

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Strong Authentication**: Enforce strong password policies and implement MFA where possible.
- **JWT Tokens**: Use short-lived JWT tokens for API authentication.
- **Fine-Grained Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC).

### Input Validation

- **Client and Server Validation**: Validate all inputs on both client and server sides.
- **Parameterized Queries**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers to mitigate XSS attacks.

### Dependency Management

- **Regular Updates**: Schedule regular dependency updates.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools like Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Lockfiles**: Commit package-lock.json to ensure consistent dependencies.

## CI/CD Pipeline Security

### Code Scanning

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Implement code scanning in the CI pipeline.
- **Secret Detection**: Scan for accidental secret commits.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step for security scanning
security-scan:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run security scan
      uses: snyk/actions/node@master
      with:
        args: --severity-threshold=high
```

### Pipeline Access Control

- **Minimum Permissions**: CI/CD service accounts should have only the permissions they need.
- **Environment Separation**: Use different service accounts for different environments.
- **Branch Protection**: Require reviews and passing checks before merging to main branches.

### Artifact Security

- **Image Signing**: Sign container images to verify authenticity.
- **Immutable Artifacts**: Use immutable tags for container images (e.g., SHA commits).
- **Artifact Scanning**: Scan built artifacts for vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Container Security

### Image Security

- **Minimal Base Images**: Use minimal base images like Alpine or Distroless.
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size and attack surface.
- **No Unnecessary Packages**: Only install required packages in the container.

### Container Runtime Security

- **Non-Root User**: Run containers as a non-root user.
- **Read-Only Filesystem**: Mount filesystems as read-only where possible.
- **Resource Limits**: Set CPU and memory limits for containers.

Example Dockerfile security practices:

```Dockerfile
# Use specific version tag for stability and security
FROM node:20-alpine AS build

# Install only production dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Run as non-root user
USER node

# Set explicit health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s \
  CMD wget -q --spider http://localhost:5000/api/health || exit 1
```

## Database Security

### Access Control

- **Least Privilege**: Database users should have minimal required permissions.
- **Connection Security**: Allow connections only from application servers.
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate database credentials.

### Data Protection

- **Sensitive Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data fields in the database.
- **Backup Encryption**: Ensure database backups are encrypted.
- **Data Masking**: Mask sensitive data in non-production environments.

### Query Security

- **ORM Security**: Use ORM features like prepared statements.
- **Query Timeouts**: Set timeouts to prevent DoS attacks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on database operations.

## Access Management

### User Access

- **IAM Best Practices**: Follow AWS IAM best practices, including:
  - Use groups to assign permissions
  - Grant least privilege
  - Enable MFA for all users
  - Regularly rotate credentials
  - Use temporary credentials when possible

### Service Access

- **Instance Roles**: Use IAM roles for EC2/ECS instead of access keys.
- **Role Separation**: Create separate roles for different services.
- **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit access permissions.

### Key Management

- **AWS KMS**: Use KMS for key management.
- **Key Rotation**: Implement automatic key rotation.
- **Limited Access**: Restrict access to encryption keys.

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

- **CloudTrail**: Enable AWS CloudTrail for API activity monitoring.
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Set up alarms for suspicious activity.
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralize logs for analysis.

### Intrusion Detection

- **GuardDuty**: Enable AWS GuardDuty for threat detection.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implement anomaly detection for unusual access patterns.
- **Automated Responses**: Set up automated responses to common threats.

### Incident Response Plan

- **Response Procedures**: Document incident response procedures.
- **Regular Drills**: Conduct regular incident response drills.
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: Perform thorough analysis after incidents.

## Compliance

### Data Protection

- **Data Classification**: Classify data according to sensitivity.
- **Retention Policies**: Implement data retention policies.
- **Right to be Forgotten**: Implement processes for data deletion requests.

### Audit Trail

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all sensitive operations.
- **Immutable Logs**: Ensure logs cannot be tampered with.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits.

### Regulatory Compliance

- **GDPR**: Ensure compliance with GDPR for EU data.
- **HIPAA**: Follow HIPAA guidelines if handling health information.
- **SOC 2**: Work towards SOC 2 compliance for service organizations.
