# Integrating Model Content Protocol (MCP) with Replit AI Agent

This document outlines how to leverage the existing Model Content Protocol (MCP) framework in the BCBS application with the Replit AI Agent approach.

## Understanding MCP in BCBS

The Model Content Protocol (MCP) is a sophisticated framework within the BCBS application that manages AI agent interactions. Based on our code analysis, the MCP system:

1. Orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents
2. Routes tasks to appropriate agents based on their capabilities
3. Manages agent state and monitoring
4. Provides structured workflows for complex tasks

## Key MCP Components in the Codebase

The MCP framework in BCBS consists of several key components:

### 1. Agent Registry

Located in `server/mcp/agents/index.ts`, the agent registry manages all available MCP agents:

- **Cost Estimation Agent**: Handles building cost calculations
- **Development Agent**: Manages code generation tasks
- **Design Agent**: Handles UI/UX design tasks
- **Data Analysis Agent**: Processes and analyzes data
- **Geospatial Analysis Agent**: Handles geographical data processing
- **Document Processing Agent**: Processes document uploads and extraction
- **Benton County Conversion Agent**: Specializes in Benton County data formats

### 2. MCP Orchestrator

Located in `server/mcp/orchestrator.ts`, the orchestrator:

- Routes requests to appropriate agents
- Manages task state and completion
- Handles agent failures and retries
- Provides event-based communication between agents

### 3. Agent API Routes

Located in `server/mcp/routes.ts`, these endpoints:

- Accept client requests for AI tasks
- Route them through the orchestrator
- Return results to the client

## Leveraging MCP with Replit AI Agent

We can enhance our development by using the Replit AI Agent to interact with the MCP framework:

### 1. MCP-Aware Prompt Templates

When working with MCP functionality, use these specialized prompt templates:

#### For Cost Estimation Tasks:

```
Leverage the Cost Estimation Agent in our MCP framework to implement the following:

1. [Describe the cost estimation feature needed]
2. The implementation should use the MCP orchestrator to route cost estimation requests
3. Update the client-side code to call the appropriate MCP API endpoint
4. Handle loading states and responses properly
5. Follow our existing patterns for MCP agent interactions
```

#### For Data Analysis Tasks:

```
Use the Data Analysis Agent in our MCP framework to implement the following:

1. [Describe the data analysis feature needed]
2. The implementation should call the MCP API endpoint for data analysis
3. Process and visualize the results
4. Handle different response types (tables, charts, insights)
5. Implement proper error handling for analysis failures
```

### 2. MCP Agent Registration

When adding new functionality that should be handled by an MCP agent:

```
Register a new capability with the appropriate MCP agent for:

1. [Describe the new capability]
2. Update the agent's handler registry in server/mcp/agents/[agent-name].ts
3. Add appropriate type definitions in shared/mcp/schemas.ts
4. Update the client-side hooks in client/src/hooks/use-mcp.ts to expose the new functionality
```

### 3. MCP Workflow Integration

For complex features that require multiple agents:

```
Create an MCP workflow that orchestrates multiple agents to implement:

1. [Describe the multi-agent feature]
2. Define the workflow steps in server/mcp/workflows/
3. Set up appropriate validation in shared/mcp-validation.ts
4. Update the client to track and display workflow progress
5. Implement proper error handling for workflow failures
```

## Example: Implementing a New Cost Analysis Feature

Here's how to use the Replit AI Agent with MCP for implementing a new cost analysis feature:

### Step 1: Define the Feature Requirements

```
I need to implement a new "Cost Trend Analysis" feature that shows how building costs have changed over time. This should:

1. Allow users to select a building type and region
2. Show cost trends over the last 5 years
3. Highlight significant changes and potential reasons
4. Provide predictive insights for future costs
```

### Step 2: Identify the MCP Agents Needed

```
Review our MCP agent capabilities and identify which agents can help implement the Cost Trend Analysis feature. Based on the requirements, which agents should be involved and what specific capabilities should we leverage from each?
```

### Step 3: Design the API and Data Flow

```
Design the API and data flow for the Cost Trend Analysis feature:

1. Create the API endpoint definition in server/mcp/routes.ts
2. Define the request/response types in shared/mcp/schemas.ts
3. Design the workflow that coordinates the Cost Estimation and Data Analysis agents
4. Determine what data preprocessing is needed
```

### Step 4: Implement the Server-Side Components

```
Implement the server-side components for the Cost Trend Analysis feature:

1. Create the workflow definition in server/mcp/workflows/costTrendAnalysis.ts
2. Update the Cost Estimation Agent to handle trend-based calculations
3. Update the Data Analysis Agent to provide trend insights
4. Add validation logic for the API parameters
```

### Step 5: Implement the Client-Side Components

```
Implement the client-side components for the Cost Trend Analysis feature:

1. Create a React component for the trend analysis UI
2. Update the use-mcp.ts hook to include the new functionality
3. Implement data visualization for the trend results
4. Add error handling and loading states
```

### Step 6: Testing and Documentation

```
Create tests and documentation for the Cost Trend Analysis feature:

1. Write unit tests for the new MCP workflow
2. Test the API endpoint with various parameters
3. Create component tests for the UI
4. Update the user documentation to include the new feature
5. Add technical documentation for the MCP workflow
```

## Best Practices for MCP + Replit AI Agent

1. **Understand Agent Boundaries**: Each MCP agent has specific capabilities - route tasks appropriately

2. **Use Typed Interfaces**: Always use the shared schemas for MCP requests and responses

3. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Maintain consistency with existing MCP implementations

4. **Handle Asynchronous Processing**: Many MCP tasks are long-running - implement proper loading states

5. **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallbacks for when MCP agents are unavailable

6. **Monitoring and Observability**: Use the MCP monitoring capabilities to track agent performance

7. **Cache Results**: For expensive MCP operations, implement appropriate caching

## Conclusion

By combining the structured PM playbook approach with the Replit AI Agent and leveraging the existing MCP framework, we can efficiently implement sophisticated AI-powered features in the BCBS application. The MCP framework provides a robust foundation for AI capabilities, while the Replit AI Agent accelerates development across the stack.
