## Overview

The BCBS application deployment pipeline follows a mature DevOps approach, incorporating multiple strategies to minimize risk, ensure quality, and provide fast feedback loops. This document details these strategies and provides practical guidance on their implementation.

## Continuous Integration

The continuous integration pipeline for BCBS runs on every push to the repository and performs the following steps:

### CI Workflow

1. **Checkout code**: Retrieve the latest code from the repository
2. **Setup environment**: Configure Node.js and other dependencies
3. **Install dependencies**: Install required packages
4. **Code quality checks**:
   - Linting (ESLint/TSLint)
   - Type checking (TypeScript)
   - Code formatting (Prettier)
5. **Security scanning**:
   - CodeQL analysis for code vulnerabilities
   - Dependency scanning with NPM audit
   - Docker image scanning with Trivy
6. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests with Playwright
   - Performance testing with Autocannon
7. **Build artifacts**: Create production-ready builds
8. **Artifact validation**: Verify built artifacts work as expected

### CI Configuration

The CI pipeline is configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for GitHub Actions. Key configurations include:

```yaml
# Example snippet of CI workflow
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      # Additional steps...
  
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run CodeQL analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
      # Additional security scanning steps...
```

## Continuous Deployment

The continuous deployment pipeline automatically deploys new code to different environments based on specific triggers.

### CD Workflow

1. **Development Environment**: Automatically deployed on every push to the `develop` branch
2. **Staging Environment**: Automatically deployed after successful CI on the `staging` branch
3. **Production Environment**: Deployed after manual approval of a staging build

### CD Configuration

The CD pipeline is configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for GitHub Actions.

## Blue-Green Deployments

Blue-green deployment is a strategy where two identical environments (blue and green) are maintained. Only one environment is live at any time, receiving all production traffic.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation**: Ensure both blue and green environments are identical
2. **Deployment**: Deploy new version to the inactive environment
3. **Testing**: Run smoke tests on the inactive environment
4. **Switch**: Redirect traffic from active to inactive environment
5. **Verification**: Monitor the new active environment
6. **Rollback**: If issues are detected, switch traffic back to the previous environment

### Example Traffic Switching Script

```javascript
// Example of a blue-green traffic switch script
const switchTraffic = async (targetEnvironment) => {
  console.log(`Switching traffic to ${targetEnvironment} environment`);
  
  // Update load balancer configuration
  await updateLoadBalancer(targetEnvironment);
  
  // Verify traffic is flowing correctly
  await verifyHealthChecks(targetEnvironment);
  
  console.log(`Traffic successfully switched to ${targetEnvironment}`);
};
```

## Canary Releases

Canary releases involve gradually rolling out a new version to a small subset of users before deploying to the entire user base.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Deploy Canary**: Deploy the new version to a small portion of the infrastructure
2. **Route Traffic**: Direct a small percentage of traffic to the canary deployment
3. **Monitor**: Closely monitor performance and error rates
4. **Gradually Increase**: If metrics are good, increase traffic to the canary
5. **Full Deployment**: Once validated, deploy to all users
6. **Rollback**: If issues are detected, route all traffic back to the previous version

### Example Canary Configuration

```javascript
// Example canary deployment configuration
const canaryConfig = {
  initialPercentage: 5,
  incrementSteps: 20,
  evaluationPeriodMinutes: 15,
  metrics: {
    errorRate: {
      threshold: 0.1  // Max 0.1% error rate
    },
    latency: {
      p95Threshold: 200  // Max 200ms p95 latency
    }
  },
  rollbackThresholds: {
    errorRate: 0.5,  // Rollback if error rate exceeds 0.5%
    availability: 99.9  // Rollback if availability drops below 99.9%
  }
};
```

## Feature Flags

Feature flags allow for enabling or disabling features at runtime without requiring code deployment.

### Usage

1. **Define features**: Define feature flags in the feature flag system
2. **Implement conditionals**: Add conditional logic in the code based on feature flags
3. **Control rollout**: Use the admin panel to control the rollout of features
4. **Monitor impact**: Track metrics to understand the impact of new features

### Example Feature Flag Implementation

```typescript
// Check if a feature is enabled
import { isFeatureEnabled } from './server/feature-flags';

// In a route or component
if (isFeatureEnabled('new-cost-calculator', { userId })) {
  // Use new calculator
} else {
  // Use old calculator
}
```

## Rollback Procedures

Despite our best efforts, sometimes deployments need to be rolled back. Our system provides multiple rollback mechanisms:

### Automated Rollbacks

The system automatically rolls back deployments if:
- Post-deployment health checks fail
- Error rates exceed thresholds
- Response times degrade significantly

### Manual Rollbacks

Manual rollbacks can be initiated through:
- The deployment dashboard
- CLI commands
- Emergency rollback procedures

### Rollback Steps

1. **Trigger rollback**: Initiate rollback via automated system or manual action
2. **Traffic switch**: Redirect traffic to the previous stable version
3. **Verification**: Verify system health after rollback
4. **Notification**: Notify relevant team members of the rollback
5. **Analysis**: Analyze reasons for rollback and take corrective actions

## Monitoring During Deployment

Enhanced monitoring is crucial during deployments to quickly identify issues.

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Error rates**: Track increased error rates across services
2. **Response times**: Monitor for increased latency
3. **Resource utilization**: Track CPU, memory, and disk usage
4. **Business metrics**: Monitor impact on key business indicators
5. **User experience**: Track user-facing performance metrics

### Dashboards

The application includes specialized deployment dashboards that:
- Compare pre and post-deployment metrics
- Highlight deviations from normal patterns
- Track DORA metrics for deployment quality

## Security Scanning

Security is integrated throughout the deployment pipeline:

1. **Static Analysis**: CodeQL runs on all PRs and builds
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Dependencies are checked for vulnerabilities
3. **Docker Image Scanning**: All container images are scanned before deployment
4. **Runtime Scanning**: Production environments have runtime security monitoring

### Vulnerability Management

When security issues are detected:
1. **Severity Assessment**: Issues are categorized by severity
2. **Notification**: Relevant teams are notified based on severity
3. **Remediation**: Fix is implemented for the vulnerability
4. **Verification**: Security scanning is repeated to verify the fix

## Conclusion

The BCBS application's advanced deployment strategies provide a robust foundation for reliable, secure, and efficient releases. By combining blue-green deployments, canary releases, and feature flags with comprehensive monitoring and security scanning, we maintain high availability while rapidly delivering new features.
