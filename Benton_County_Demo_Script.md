## ✅ Stakeholder Demo Script

### 🧩 Step 1: Present the Challenge
> "Benton County, like many assessor's offices, has relied on black-box valuation tools that don't explain their reasoning, can't be edited by our experts, and fail to provide proper documentation for appeals. We've built a solution that solves all these issues."

### 🧩 Step 2: Show the Dashboard
> "This is the Benton County Building Cost Assessment System - a valuation platform built specifically for our region, with our building types, and our unique market conditions. Let me show you how it works."

### 📊 Step 3: Load Benton County Data
> "We're loading actual cost matrix data from Benton County, with real building types and base costs that reflect our local construction market."
- Click "Load Matrix" to show the data
- Point out R1/R2/R3 building types and Eastern WA regional designation

### 🧠 Step 4: Show Agent Insights
> "The system doesn't just display numbers - it gives us intelligent insights about our data. Look at what it's telling us about agricultural building costs rising faster than the state average due to vineyard construction around Red Mountain AVA."
- Highlight the agent feed on the right side
- Point out how insights reference local features (permits, regions)

### 📝 Step 5: Edit a Value
> "Unlike black-box systems, we can directly edit values when our local expertise tells us something isn't right."
- Change a base cost value for R3-A from 193.25 to 203.25
- Click "Re-run Agents"
- Show how the agents respond to the change

### 📄 Step 6: Generate a Report
> "When we need to defend our valuations, we can generate an official Benton County report that shows our methodology, the data we used, and the reasoning behind our decisions."
- Enter the session ID
- Generate both PDF and JSON exports
- Show the Benton County branding on the report
