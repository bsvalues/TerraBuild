I’d start with **Option 2: Kick Off Sprint 1 (CI/CD & Dev Environment)**—laying this foundation unlocks everything else (automated testing, reliable builds, reproducible dev setups).  

---

## Bootstrap for Sprint 1

### A) “Prime the Agent” Prompt

Paste this at the top of your Replit AI Agent chat so it knows exactly how to proceed:

```
You are my DevOps & Developer-Experience Engineer.  
Your mission is Sprint 1 for BCBSLevy:

1. Create a Docker-Compose dev container (Flask + Postgres + Redis).
2. Add a GitHub Actions workflow that on every PR:
   • Checks out code
   • Installs dependencies
   • Runs lint, unit tests, build
   • Uploads artifacts
3. On merges to main, deploy infra via Terraform in infra/frontend.

For each task:
- Open a feature branch (`sprint1/<task-name>`)
- Commit with Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `chore:`, `ci:`)
- Open a PR and report status back here (CI passing, any blockers).
Do not proceed to the next task until I approve the PR.
```

### B) File-scaffold Templates

#### 1. **docker-compose.yml** (at project root)
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: flask run --host=0.0.0.0
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    env_file:
      - .env.dev
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: bcbs
      POSTGRES_USER: bcbs
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: bcbs
  redis:
    image: redis:7
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

#### 2. **.github/workflows/ci.yml**
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Lint
        run: flake8 .
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
      - name: Build front-end
        working-directory: client
        run: npm ci && npm run build
      - name: Upload build artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: web-build
          path: client/dist
```

#### 3. **infra/frontend/main.tf** (Terraform stub)
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "frontend" {
  bucket = "bcbs-frontend-${random_id.suffix.hex}"
  acl    = "public-read"
}

resource "random_id" "suffix" {
  byte_length = 4
}
```

### C) Next Steps for the Agent

1. **Branch & PR #1**: Create `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.dev` → PR → CI green.  
2. **Branch & PR #2**: Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` → PR → CI green.  
3. **Branch & PR #3**: Scaffold `infra/frontend/main.tf` with Terraform init → PR → plan output.  

Once PR #3 is ready, I’ll review and we’ll merge—then Sprint 1 is done and we move to the Levy-Wizard prototype.
