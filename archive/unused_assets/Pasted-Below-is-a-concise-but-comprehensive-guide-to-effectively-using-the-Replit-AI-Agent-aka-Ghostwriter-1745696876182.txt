Below is a concise but comprehensive guide to effectively using the Replit AI Agent (aka Ghostwriter) in your Replit workspace. You’ll learn how to set it up, craft prompts that deliver consistent and high-quality results, leverage advanced features, and troubleshoot common issues—all backed by official documentation and community best practices.

The Replit AI Agent lets you describe your desired application or feature in plain English and generates complete scaffolds, API endpoints, or UI components within minutes.

 Ghostwriter complements this by offering in-editor code completions, transformations, and context-aware suggestions as you type.

1. Overview of Replit AI Agent
Replit Agent transforms natural-language descriptions into fully functioning Replit projects and features, automating setup and scaffolding tasks in minutes.

Ghostwriter is the built-in pair programmer that completes code, refactors, and explains code context directly in the IDE.

2. Getting Started
2.1 Enabling the Agent
Open your Replit workspace and click the AI icon on the left toolbar to reveal the Agent and Assistant panels. 
Replit

If prompted, select your AI model (options may include OpenAI GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, etc.) to power the Agent.

2.2 Your First Prompt
Scaffolding a project:

sql
Copy
Edit
“Create a React app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, including ESLint configured for Airbnb style.”  
This will generate the file structure, config files, and install dependencies for you.

3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices
Review before changing

Ask the Agent to analyze current code and outline modules before applying changes:
“Review the /server/routes directory and summarize its endpoints without making edits.”

Break tasks into steps

First request an analysis, then request the implementation:

“List the missing CRUD operations in the User module.”

“Now generate the missing methods with Zod validation.”

Provide context

Paste relevant snippets or link specific files (main.tsx, routes.ts) so the Agent can reference exact code.

Specify output format

Example: “Return only the diff of modified files in unified diff format.” 
Replit Docs

4. Leveraging Advanced Features
Boilerplate generation: Use Ghostwriter to fill repetitive code patterns, e.g., React hooks or repository classes. 
Replit

Multi-file changes: For large features (“Add cost-matrix API endpoints and TypeScript interfaces”), prompt the Agent to generate all related files at once. 
Replit Docs

Interactive debugging: Ask the Assistant to explain error logs or stack traces:
“Explain why calling GET /api/property returns a 500 and suggest fixes.” 
Replit Docs

5. Troubleshooting and Tips
Outline issues first: If the Agent’s edits aren’t correct, instruct it to “list all console errors and proposed fixes without altering code.”

Use custom templates: In Workspace Settings → AI, define reusable prompt templates for your common workflows.
