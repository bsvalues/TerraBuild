# Archive Directory

This directory contains legacy code, experimental scripts, and deprecated components that may be referenced for historical context but are not part of the active codebase.

## Structure

- `legacy_parsers/` - Historical cost matrix parsing scripts
- `experimental/` - Proof-of-concept implementations
- `deprecated_docs/` - Outdated documentation
- `unused_assets/` - Media files no longer in active use
- `old_imports/` - Legacy data import scripts

## Archive Policy

Files are moved here when:
- Functionality has been superseded by newer implementations
- Code is no longer maintained or used
- Assets are no longer referenced in active components
- Documentation has been replaced with updated versions

## Retrieval

If archived code needs to be restored:
1. Identify the specific file/functionality needed
2. Review for compatibility with current architecture
3. Update dependencies and coding standards before integration
4. Test thoroughly before moving back to active codebase
