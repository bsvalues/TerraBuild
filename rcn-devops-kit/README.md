## Overview

This package is designed for county assessors and property valuation professionals who need a reliable, consistent method for calculating building replacement costs. The RCN Valuation Engine uses industry-standard valuation methodologies updated for 2025 and can be deployed in various IT environments.

### Key Features

- **Accurate Cost Calculations**: Uses up-to-date cost matrices for different building types and construction methods
- **Flexible Deployment Options**: Run as a standalone application or Windows service
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple web UI for performing calculations
- **API Access**: RESTful API for integration with existing systems
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed usage guides and API specifications

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016/2019/2022
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Python 3.8 or higher (automatically detected or can be specified)
  - Network connectivity (for initial setup only)
  - Administrative privileges (for service installation only)

## Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to get the RCN Valuation Engine up and running quickly:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the installer script to set up all required dependencies:

```bat
install_deps.bat
```

This script will:
- Check for Python installation
- Create a virtual environment
- Install required packages
- Set up sample data for testing

### 2. Start the Server

Launch the RCN Valuation Engine server:

```bat
start_rcn.bat
```

By default, the server runs on port 8000. To use a different port:

```bat
start_rcn.bat 8080
```

### 3. Access the Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000/ui
```

This will display the RCN calculator where you can enter building specifications and calculate replacement costs.

## Windows Service Installation

For persistent deployment, you can install the engine as a Windows service:

1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
2. Run:
   ```bat
   windows_service\install_service.bat
   ```

This will install and start the "TerraFusionRCN" service. The service will automatically start when Windows boots.

To uninstall the service:
```bat
windows_service\uninstall_service.bat
```

## Building a Standalone Executable

For easier distribution or deployment to systems without Python, you can create a standalone executable:

```bat
build_exe.bat
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` folder.

## Creating a Deployment Package

To create a complete deployment package for distribution:

```bat
create_deployment_package.bat
```

This will create a ZIP file in the `deployment` folder containing all necessary files for installation on another system.

## API Usage

### API Documentation

The API documentation is available at:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

This interactive documentation allows you to try out API endpoints directly from the browser.

### Sample API Request

Calculate an RCN value via API:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/rcn/calculate" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "use_type": "Residential",
  "construction_type": "Wood Frame",
  "sqft": 1800,
  "year_built": 2010,
  "quality_class": "B",
  "locality_index": 1.05,
  "condition": "Good"
}'
```

## Customization

### Using Your Own Cost Data

To use custom cost matrices:
1. Create JSON files following the format in the `sample_data` directory
2. Replace the existing sample data files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server won't start**: Ensure Python is correctly installed and in your PATH
2. **Service fails to install**: Make sure you're running as Administrator
3. **Can't access web UI**: Check that the server is running and confirm the port is not blocked

### Log Files

Log files are stored in the `logs` directory and can help diagnose issues:
- Server logs: `logs/server.log`
- Service logs: `logs/service_stdout.log` and `logs/service_stderr.log`
