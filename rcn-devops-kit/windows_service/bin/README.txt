NSSM - Non-Sucking Service Manager
====================================================

The Windows service scripts in this package require the NSSM utility to create and manage Windows services.

Due to licensing restrictions, the NSSM binary is not included in this distribution package.

To use the Windows service functionality:

1. Download NSSM from the official website:
   https://nssm.cc/download

2. Extract the nssm.exe file (choose the appropriate version for your system - 32-bit or 64-bit)

3. Place the nssm.exe file in this directory (windows_service/bin/)

4. The install_service.bat and uninstall_service.bat scripts will then be able to find and use NSSM
