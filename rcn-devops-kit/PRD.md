### 4. User Stories

#### 4.1 County Assessor

- As a county assessor, I want to calculate the replacement cost of a residential building so that I can determine its assessed value.
- As a county assessor, I want to see a detailed breakdown of the cost calculation so that I can explain it to property owners.
- As a county assessor, I want to adjust locality factors so that calculations reflect local market conditions.

#### 4.2 IT Administrator

- As an IT administrator, I want to install the system as a Windows service so that it runs automatically on startup.
- As an IT administrator, I want to deploy without complex setup steps so that I can quickly roll it out to multiple machines.
- As an IT administrator, I want to configure the port number so that it doesn't conflict with existing services.

### 5. Performance Requirements

- API response time for single calculation: < 500ms
- Web UI load time: < 2 seconds
- Memory footprint: < 200MB (service mode)
- Startup time: < 5 seconds

### 6. Security Requirements

- No personally identifiable information (PII) stored
- Local deployment only (no cloud components)
- No external network access required after installation
- No administrative privileges required for normal operation (only for service installation)

### 7. Constraints

- Must run on Windows environments (primary OS used by county assessors)
- Must function without internet connectivity after installation
- Must be deployable via USB or network share
- Must not require database setup

### 8. Success Metrics

- Successful deployment in < 10 minutes
- Calculation accuracy within 2% of industry standards
- < 5 support requests per month after initial deployment

### 9. Future Considerations

- Integration with GIS systems for spatial analysis
- Mobile companion application for field assessments
- Multi-user support with centralized database
- Custom reporting module
- Support for Linux/macOS environments
