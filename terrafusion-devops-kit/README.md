# TerraFusion DevOps Kit

A comprehensive DevOps toolkit for deploying, managing and scaling the TerraFusion AI platform. This kit provides infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, observability, and automation tools for the TerraFusion ecosystem.

## 🚀 Overview

The TerraFusion DevOps Kit provides a complete set of tools and processes for operationalizing the AI agent-based infrastructure optimization platform. It's designed to support the full lifecycle of development, testing, deployment, and monitoring across multiple environments.

## 📋 Features

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform configurations for AWS resources
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and deployment
- **Container Management**: Docker configurations for all components
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: Manifests for Kubernetes deployments
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for monitoring and logging
- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault integration for secure credential handling
- **Deployment Automation**: Scripts for zero-downtime rollouts
- **Backup & Disaster Recovery**: Tools for data resilience
- **Security Scanning**: Tools for vulnerability detection and mitigation

## 🛠️ Components

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

The `terraform` directory contains configurations for creating and managing cloud infrastructure:

- VPC and networking
- EKS clusters for Kubernetes workloads
- RDS PostgreSQL databases
- S3 buckets for data storage
- ECR repositories for container images
- IAM roles and policies
- CloudWatch monitoring

### 2. CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)

The `github-actions` directory contains workflows for:

- Backend services
- Frontend applications
- AI Agent swarm
- Infrastructure changes

### 3. Containerization (Docker)

The `docker` directory contains:

- Base images for various components
- Agent-specific Dockerfiles
- Multi-stage optimized builds
- Security-focused configurations

### 4. Kubernetes Configuration

The `k8s-manifests` directory contains:

- Deployment manifests
- Service definitions
- Persistent volume claims
- Configuration maps
- Secrets management
- Namespace definitions

### 5. Observability Stack

Configurations for:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Loki for log aggregation
- Tempo for distributed tracing
- Custom dashboards for AI agents

### 6. Deployment Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains utilities for:

- Database migrations
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Secret rotation
- Agent retraining
- Backup/restore procedures

## 🏗️ Architecture

The TerraFusion platform uses a microservices architecture with the following key components:

1. **Backend Services**: Node.js Express APIs
2. **Frontend Application**: React-based UI
3. **AI Agent Swarm**: Specialized AI agents for different optimization tasks
4. **Model Content Protocol (MCP)**: Framework for agent communication
5. **PostgreSQL Database**: Data persistence layer
6. **Redis Cache**: Performance optimization
7. **EFS Storage**: Shared file storage for models and training data

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- GitHub account with repository access
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Terraform CLI
- kubectl configured for Kubernetes access
- AWS CLI

### Initial Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Initialize Terraform for your desired environment

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init -backend-config=environments/dev.tfbackend
```

3. Create initial infrastructure

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
```

4. Set up GitHub repository secrets for CI/CD
5. Push changes to trigger initial deployments

## 🔄 Deployment Workflows

### Standard Deployment Process

1. Code changes are pushed to GitHub
2. CI pipeline runs tests and builds containers
3. Containers are pushed to ECR
4. CD pipeline deploys to appropriate environment
5. Health checks verify successful deployment

### Agent Deployment Process

AI agents follow a specialized deployment process:

1. Agent code changes trigger CI process
2. Build and testing validate the agent
3. Agent container is built and pushed to ECR
4. Deployment updates the agent in the Kubernetes cluster
5. Agent retraining may be triggered if needed

## 📊 Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection

- Infrastructure metrics
- Application performance metrics
- Agent-specific metrics
- Model performance metrics

### Logging

- Centralized log collection with Loki
- Structured logging for all components
- Log-based alerting for critical errors

### Alerting

- Multi-channel notifications (Slack, email, PagerDuty)
- Customizable alert thresholds
- Alert aggregation and de-duplication

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- Infrastructure security (network isolation, IAM least privilege)
- Container security (vulnerability scanning, minimal base images)
- Data security (encryption at rest and in transit)
- Secret management (HashiCorp Vault integration)
- Compliance monitoring (automated checks)
