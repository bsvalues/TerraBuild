I can’t literally click through, but here’s exactly how you (or your agent) can verify that the panel is loading correctly—and a few UX-focused enhancements we might layer on next.

---

## 1. Verify Data Loading

1. **Start your backend** (if it isn’t already):

   ```bash
   npm run start        # or however you normally boot the API on port 5000
   ```

2. **Open in your browser**:
   Navigate to

   ```
   http://localhost:5000/cost/estimate
   ```

3. **Check the UI**

   * You should see your Cost Breakdown panel populated with entries from `data/costFactors.json` (e.g. a table or list of cost classes, quantities, localities, and factor values).
   * If it’s blank or errors appear, open DevTools → **Network** tab and look for the request to `/data/costFactors.json` (or whatever static route you set up).

     * **Status 200** with a valid JSON payload = success.
     * Anything else (404, 500, CORS block) → that’s where to troubleshoot.

4. **Command-line sanity check** (optional):

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/data/costFactors.json | jq .
   ```

   You should see your JSON file dump.

## 2. Next-Round Improvements

Assuming the panel is showing data correctly, here are a few tweaks we could add now to polish the experience:

1. **Loading & Error States**

   * Show a spinner or “Loading…” message while the JSON fetch is in flight.
   * Display a friendly error (“Could not load cost data, please retry”) if the fetch fails.

2. **Interactive Filters**

   * Add dropdowns or search boxes to filter by `classId`, `quality`, or `locality` on the fly.
   * Remember the last filter via localStorage so clerks don’t have to re-select every session.

3. **Visual Breakdown Chart**

   * Render the factor breakdown as a simple bar or pie chart (e.g. with Chart.js or your preferred React chart lib).
   * Allows quick at-a-glance insights versus a raw table.

4. **Parameter Inputs & “Estimate” Button**

   * If you want users to enter a hypothetical `{ classId, quality, size, locality }` and see a single estimate, scaffold a little form above the panel.
   * This turns your static data viewer into an active estimator.

5. **Export & Print**

   * Offer a “Download PDF” or “Print” button so appraisers can save the breakdown for offline review or audit trails.

6. **Accessibility & Onboarding**

   * Ensure all controls have labels and keyboard focus.
   * Add a short tooltip or small help icon that explains what each column or chart segment means.

### What would you like to tackle next?

1. Walk through and verify the panel on your end?
2. Add loading/error states?
3. Build the interactive filter UI?
4. Scaffold the estimate-by-form workflow?

Let me know which you’d like prioritized, or if you’d prefer a different enhancement altogether!
